Appending to the middle of a file in Python requires a bit more work than simply appending to the end of the file. You will need to read the contents of the file, find the middle point, and then write the new content into the middle. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Read the entire file content.
2. Find the middle point of the file.
3. Split the content into two parts at the middle point.
4. Append the new content between the two parts.
5. Write the modified content back to the file.

Here is an example:

python
def append_in_middle(filename, text_to_append):
    # Step 1: Read the entire file content
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()

    # Step 2: Find the middle point of the file
    middle_index = len(content) // 2

    # Step 3: Split the content into two parts
    part1 = content[:middle_index]
    part2 = content[middle_index:]

    # Step 4: Append the new content between the two parts
    new_content = part1 + text_to_append + part2

    # Step 5: Write the modified content back to the file
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(new_content)

Usage
filename = 'example.txt'
text_to_append = 'This is the new content to append.'
append_in_middle(filename, text_to_append)


Explanation:

1. **Reading the File Content**:
    - Open the file in read mode (`'r'`) and read its entire content into a variable.

2. **Finding the Middle Point**:
    - Calculate the middle index of the file content. `len(content) // 2` gives the integer division of the length of the content by 2, which is the middle point.

3. **Splitting the Content**:
    - Split the content into two parts: `part1` (from the beginning to the middle) and `part2` (from the middle to the end).

4. **Appending the New Content**:
    - Concatenate `part1`, the new text to append, and `part2` to form the new content.

5. **Writing the Modified Content**:
    - Open the file in write mode (`'w'`) and write the new content back to the file. This will overwrite the original file with the modified content.

This approach ensures that the new content is inserted exactly in the middle of the existing content of the file. Note that this method reads and writes the entire content of the file, which can be memory-intensive for very large files. For extremely large files, a more efficient approach involving file streams and temporary files might be necessary.
