In C++ and Java, the equivalent to the `pass` statement in Python, which is used to indicate that nothing happens, is an empty statement. Below, I'll provide examples for both languages showing how to use an empty statement.

### C++

In C++, an empty statement is represented by a semicolon (`;`). Here's an example demonstrating its use in a function and a loop:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void exampleFunction() {
    // Equivalent to Python's `pass`
    ;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage in a loop
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        // Equivalent to Python's `pass`
        ;
    }
    std::cout << "Completed empty statements in C++" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Java

In Java, an empty statement is also represented by a semicolon (`;`). Here's an example demonstrating its use in a method and a loop:

```java
public class EmptyStatementExample {

    public static void exampleMethod() {
        // Equivalent to Python's `pass`
        ;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage in a loop
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            // Equivalent to Python's `pass`
            ;
        }
        System.out.println("Completed empty statements in Java");
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **C++**: In the `exampleFunction` and the `for` loop, a semicolon is used to indicate that no action is performed, similar to Python's `pass`.
- **Java**: In the `exampleMethod` and the `for` loop, a semicolon serves the same purpose, indicating that no operation is carried out.

### Summary

In both C++ and Java, an empty statement (semicolons `;`) serves as a placeholder where the language syntax requires a statement but no action is desired. This is functionally equivalent to Python's `pass` statement.
